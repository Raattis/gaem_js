Poking around with web development stuff. Sorry for the mess.

# How to run

In a terminal window
```sh
./docker_build.sh
./docker_create_volumes.sh
./docker_run_server.sh
```

In another terminal window
```sh
./docker_run_client.sh
```

To rerun either client or server rerun the corresponding `./docker_run_*.sh` script.
